# Overview

When OCP installs a cluster it sets the ClusterVerison channel to the stable for that major.minor.  So if you install a cluster using an image available only in a candidate channel the in-cluster channel is still on stable.  No upgrades will be listed available until that cluster's version is in the stable channel OR the in-cluster channel is updated.

For OSD this is a challenge as customer do not have permission to manage this directly in cluster.  OCM uses telemeter to identify the channel and available upgrades for a cluster.  Therefore to boostrap this we've created this simple set of SSS to patch the channel based on the labels on ClusterDeployments (CD).

If CD indicates it is in the fast or candidate channel we use the major.minor label to pick the right SelectorSyncSet (SSS) an patch the channel in-cluster.  This gets us the initial channel corrected.  On upgrade, OCM will create an UpgradeConfig via SyncSet that contains the new target channel.  This is then set in-cluster before the upgrade is initiated.  Once upgraded, the version and channel is fed out to telemeter.

On a minor upgrade (i.e. 4.5.z to 4.6.z) it is possible that hive will reset the channel before we get updated version information.  This is OK as the upgrade is already initiated or done and the channel is only used when assessing if an upgrade can be _started_.  Once the upgrade is complete the version is sent to telemter and ultimately is reflected in the ClusterDeployment.  This in-turn will trigger the appropriate patch from SSS created in the configuration here.

NOTE that if OCP moves to a version agnostic channel strategy that we do not need as many of these SSS and can patch just to the channel `candidate`, `fast`, or `stable`.

# Updating for new versions

We can pre-populate future minor versions by copying previous versions and updating them. For example, the following command was used to populate 4.14 through 4.19:
```bash
for minor in {15..19}; do for channel in stable fast candidate; do cp -R ${channel}-4.14 ${channel}-4.${minor}; gsed -i -e s/4\.14/4\.${minor}/g ${channel}-4.${minor}/*.yaml; done; done
```

# Use Cases

Because there are 2 systems that are managing the in-cluster channel I wanted to walk through possible scenarios and work out if there are any conflicts.  I will use stable and candidate channels in this example but could just as easily swap out fast for candidate, the behavior is the same.

NOTE managed-upgrade-operator (MUO) is used in cluster to perform channel updates and initiate upgrade.

**Key Constraints**

* OCM sets channel label on CD at provision time.
* OCM does not set channel label on CD whenever it's changed via OCM.
* MUO sets channel on scheduled upgrade.


## Install stable, z-stream upgrade to stable

1. Install to stable channel.
3. Hive sync stable-major.minor to cluster channel.
4. Customer sets upgrade schedule
5. MUO sets channel to stable-major.minor
6. Hive sync stable-major.minor to cluster channel.
10. Upgrade started.
