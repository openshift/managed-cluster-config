# The current HAProxyReloadFail within 4.5.x, 4.6.x is currently a no-op.
# This alert self resolves ~ 5 mins. This alert will not be back ported until
# after the company recharge. Until backport is complete, the original alert
# will be sent to null reciver in CAM-operator and a custom SREP alert will
# replace it with a higher duration.
