        Your cluster requires you to take action as there are multiple ingress controllers detected. Red Hat SRE strongly recommends using Openshift-managed Custom Domains instead, as multiple ingress controllers, if improperly configured, can lead to problems with internal and external networking.

        Your cluster is currently alerting with 'KubePersistentVolumeFillingUp' in '${namespace}' for PVC '${persistentvolumeclaim}'. This is not an actionable alert for the SRE team. Please address this capacity issue using this reference documentation: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/storage/expanding-persistent-volumes.html.

        Your cluster requires you to take action as its ElasticSearch cluster logging deployment has been detected as reaching a high disk usage threshold. Red Hat SRE strongly recommends reducing application logging on your cluster to ensure logging continues to function. If logging disk consumption exceeds 95%, data will be at risk of becoming unavailable or lost and the stability of your ElasticSearch deployment may be impacted.

        Your cluster's ElasticSearch deployment is detected as being at safe disk consumption levels and no additional action on this issue is required.

        Your cluster requires you to take action. SRE has observed that there is more than one default Storage Class configured for your cluster. Please specify one default storage class for your persistent volume claims.

        A user on your system has removed a platform protection webhook. This protection has already been automatically replaced, and no further action is required. Tampering with platform protections can endanger SLAs.

    - activeBody: Your cluster requires you to take action. The kernel file descriptor
        limit for a worker node is currently at or above 90% and is predicted to be
        fully exhausted soon. This will prevent applications on the node from opening
        and operating on files. Without action, your cluster's SLA and ability to upgrade
        may be impacted. Please reduce the number of simultaneously-open files on this
        node, either by adjusting application configuration or by moving some applications
        to other nodes.

        Red Hat has detected that your cluster is running multiple versions of EFS CSI driver. This configuration is not safe to use as this might lead to the EFS Operator not working as expected. Please use the officially supported version of EFS operator as described in https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4591701.

        Your cluster requires you to take action. The file system usage for a worker node is currently at or above 90% and is predicted to be fully exhausted soon. Without action, this could impact the usability of this node. Please reduce the amount of space used on this mountpoint, either by adjusting application configuration or by moving some applications to other nodes.

        Your cluster requires you to take action. A workload is been preventing a machine from deleting. The name of the workload can be found by looking at the 'pods_preventing_node_drain' metric in Prometheus. Not taking action can result in higher compute costs as the instance won't terminate until the workload has been moved.
