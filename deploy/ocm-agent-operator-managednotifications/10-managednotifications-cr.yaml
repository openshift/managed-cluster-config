        Your cluster requires you to take action as its ElasticSearch cluster logging deployment has been detected as reaching a high disk usage threshold. Red Hat SRE strongly recommends reducing application logging on your cluster to ensure logging continues to function. If logging disk consumption exceeds 95%, data will be at risk of becoming unavailable or lost and the stability of your ElasticSearch deployment may be impacted.
