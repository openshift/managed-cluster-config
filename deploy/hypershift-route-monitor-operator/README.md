# File Convention

the convention is:
```
${NUMBER}-${NS}.${NAME}.${TYPE}.yaml
```

## Number
a way to order the resources (if need be),
should be a 3 digit number just in case.

## Ns
the namespace the resource is created in

## Name
the name of the resource

## Type
the type of the resource

# Caveat
the alert name will be comprised from the RouteMonitor/ClusterUrlMonitor name, so be careful when renaming || Adding
